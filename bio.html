        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Matt Browne and this is a test website created as part of the Software Engineering pre-work course at Flatiron School.
           I have previously completed a doctoral degree in music composition at the University of Michigan and work as a freelance composer.
           I am transitioning to a new career in software engineering as a supplement to my music composition work. I have has music performed by
           numerous classical ensembles and orchestras. <br><br>The image below is the entire full score to my first symphony, entitled <i>The Course of Empire</i>,
           reformatted to fit on a single large page... I just thought it looked cool. Please <strong>hover</strong> over the image to get a closer look!
